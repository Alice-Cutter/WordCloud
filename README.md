# WordCloud
Hello! You have reached Alice Cutter's WordCloud Maker. Woohoo .

This projected I did in my Data Structures class in 2021. 

WordCloudMaker takes in a textfile and the number of words to include and creates a word cloud. The code for the word clouds are written to a .html file with the name of the file that they were created from as the first part of the name. 

To run the program type the following into the console (this was originally written in Replit):  
1. javac 
2. java WordCounter cloud <textFileName> <numberOfWordsToInclude> 

You can then cut and paste the html file into an html processor and see what the wordcloud looks like. 


Here is the link to a website that does it: https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer
